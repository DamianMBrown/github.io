	<p>In the prologue of "The Way of Kings," Szeth-son-son-Vallano, known as Truthless of Shinovar, is compelled by the Parshendi to assassinate King Gavilar on the very day a treaty is being signed between the Kingdom of Alethkar and the Parshendi.
	Despite his confusion over the betrayal of the newly formed treaty, Szeth obediently carries out his orders, utilizing his rare abilities as a Surgebinder and wielding an Honorblade.
	In a violent confrontation, he confronts Gavilar, who is revealed to be the king himself, and ultimately slays him. Before dying, Gavilar entrusts Szeth with a mysterious glowing orb and cryptically urges him to convey a vital message to his brother.
	Szeth, bound by tradition, fulfills Gavilar's last wish before vanishing into the night.</p>
